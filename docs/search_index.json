"],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic S&amp;P 500 Index is a market-capitalization-weighted index of many of the largest US stocks. As it covers over 80% the market capitalization of the US market, it is widely considered to represent the US market in the global financial asset allocators. As a result, the E-Mini S&amp;P 500 Futures is also one of the most commonly used futures for investors and traders to gain exposure to the US market. Most commonly referred as ES futures, it is available for trading each week from each 6pm ET Sunday to 5pm ET Friday (including a short halt each day from 4:15-4:30pm and 5pm to 6pm). Source: https://www.thebalancemoney.com/profile-of-the-sandp-500-es-futures-market-1031271 Anecdotally, we have observed that on some Fridays, the ES futures exhibit very strong returns in the final 30 minutes heading into the week’s 5pm close, in a way that may indicate a short squeeze. A short squeeze is when a surge of the market cover shorted stocks pushes the price of a stock up in a parabolic way. The topic we want to explore in this project is to examine if this is a regular occurrence. We will study if this pattern appears conditional on previous S&amp;P 500 market return conditions, market’s valuation, future’s daily trading volume, net positioning, as well as level of market volatility and investor sentiment. In addition, we will examine if a market return profile is conditional on potential market moving macro-economic events such as rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, or announcements of economic data such as ISM Manufacturing Index. 2.2 Data availability In order to investigate the return behavior the E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures and the market conditions, we need historical pricing, volume data, and many market and sentiment indicators. Bloomberg Terminal is the application used by many professionals in the financial industry. It aggregates and distributes market data, news, among many things, and is valuable resource for us to retrieve market related data in our project. We plan to use Bloomberg Terminal accessible through the University’s Library Terminals, to download pricing and volume data for E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures. Bloomberg has various access methods to its data, and we intend on using BDH function calls to pull “Bloomberg Data History”. We anticipate to use Excel to call for the necessary historical data, as such data will be downloaded into a spreadsheet format. E-mini S&amp;P 500 Futures The E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures identifier is ES1 Index, the Generic ES future security that Bloomberg tracks and will provide continuous pricing going back in history. Bloomberg will only provide 140 days of historical intraday prices when downloading from Excel, and 240 days of intraday prices from the Terminal. That is, if today is October 30, 2022, only prices up to 240 days ago is available from the Terminal. This will limit our study to approximately the past 1 year of trading days. Pricing and volume The data fields we intend on accessing include the following, using the respective Bloomberg codes: - 15 minute intraday prices for each Friday going back in available history (LAST_PRICE) - Daily volume (VOLUME) Net Positioning The net-positioning of the E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures indicate the market sentiment based on whether the net position is from very long to very short. We will download this from the Bloomberg Terminal using IMMOENCN Index, which gives a weekly series of non-commercial net-positioning data for our SP500 futures. This data is collected on a weekly basis, so the date associated with the data point may appear on a lag. That is, the data for 10/25/2022 may not be available until a few days after 10/25/2022. We plot the relationship visually knowing that there is a lag in when the associated data becomes available. Market data - valuation, volatility, and sentiment S&amp;P 500 Market Valuation Similar to E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures, we can also retrieve market data pertaining S&amp;P 500 data through the Bloomberg Terminal. Specifically, we are interested in the daily market valuation of the market (using the S&amp;P 500 Index – SPX Index), as measured by the Price to Earnings Ratio with the Bloomberg code: PE_RATIO. Market Volatility We will use the CBOE Volatility Index, also known as VIX, to represent market expectation of volatility. This is also available through the Bloomberg Terminal, using LAST_PRICE code against VIX Index. We will collect daily time series for this. Investor Sentiment AAII provides a weekly investment sentiment index called “AAII Sentiment Survey” that measures the percentage of individual investors’ future 6 month outlook for stocks. The results is categorized into “Bullish”, “Bearish”, and “Neutral”. We collect this from the Bloomberg Terminal (AAIIBULL Index, AAIIBEAR Index, and AAIINEUT Index), using the LAST_PRICE code for this weekly series. Macro-Economic Data Federal Funds Rate Federal Funds Rate is the “interest rate depository institutions charge each other for overnight loans of funds”, or the benchmark of the price of borrowing money between financial institutions. This rate is determined by the Federal Reserve, and can be updated after each of the 8 pre-scheduled meetings by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Banks transact with each other at this rate, and the weighted average rate for all of these is the “Effective Federal Funds Rate.” This is one of the key data points for the US economy, as a lower rate incentivizes spending and stimulates economic activity. Higher rates, on the other hand, does the opposite, including slowing the economy and inflation. The Effective Federal Funds Rate can be downloaded from the FRED Economic Data website, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF. It is a daily data series, available 7 days, and has history going back to 1955. It can be downloaded into an Excel spreadsheet or a CSV file. ISM Manufacturing Index The ISM Manufacturing Index is a monthly survey of “purchasing managers at more than 300 manufacturing firms”, available on the first business day of each month. It is a key indicator of the state of US economic activity, and its release can impact markets. This monthly series is also available on Bloomberg Terminal, under the code “NAPMPMI Index”. It’s earliest data available is on 1/31/1948. It can be exported directly from the Terminal into an Excel or a csv file. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ism-mfg.asp "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources The data we need for our study is available in Bloomberg Terminal Application, accessible in Columbia University’s Library Bloomberg Terminal. Phillip Kim spent a morning at the library, and used the export Data function for each of the data items listed below and their respective Bloomberg functions. The exported data is then saved into individual worksheets within an Excel workbook named “bloomberg Data PK.xlsx” The primary hurdle that we faced in data collection was realizing that the intraday pricing history for the SP500 futures was only trailing one year from the download date. That will limit our dependent variable of each day’s closing returns to only one year of data. 3.1.1 E-mini Futures Bloomberg identifier: ES1 Index Fields: Price (LAST_PRICE) and Volume (VOLUME) Details: Choose 15 minute pricing interval going as far back as possible. This returns us data from 10/17/2021 18:00 to 11/1/2022 10:15am, a total of 23585 rows. 3.1.2 Net Positioning Bloomberg identifier: IMMOENCN Index Fields: LAST_PRICE Details: This net positioning data is a weekly series of non-commercial net-positioning against our SP500 futures. We downloaded 669 rows of data since 1/31/2010, but since our data starts 10/17/2021 we’ll only use about 53 weeks of data. 3.1.3 Market Valuation Bloomberg Identifier: SPX Index Fields: PE_RATIO Details: P/E ratio data is daily, and we downloaded data all the way back to 2010 (3230 rows). Since our pricing data starts 10/17/2021, we’ll only use 259 rows of data. 3.1.4 Market Volatility Bloomberg Identifier: VIX Index Fields: LAST_PRICE Details: The VIX index is a daily series, and we downloaded data all the way back to 2010 (3234 rows). Since our pricing data starts 10/17/2021, we’ll only use 263 rows of data. 3.1.5 Investor Sentiment Bloomberg Identifier: AAIIBEAR Index and AAIIBULL Index Fields: LAST_PRICE Details: AAII’s sentiment index is a weekly survey, and while we plan to use a “Net Bull” sentiment (Bull Sentiment - Bear Sentiment) we must download them individually. We downloaded 668 rows of weekly data since 2010, and will use 54 rows to cover the 1 year of return pricing data. 3.1.6 Federal Funds Rate Bloomberg Identifier: FDFD Index Fields: LAST_PRICE Details: The Fed Funds Effective Rate is a daily series, and we downloaded data all the way back to 2010 (3227 rows). Since our pricing data starts 10/17/2021, we’ll only use 259 rows of data. 3.1.7 ISM Manufacturing and Services PMI Index Bloomberg Identifier: NAPMPMI Index and NAPMNMI Index Fields: LAST_PRICE Details: The ISM surveys is a monthly series, and we downloaded data all the way back to 2010 (154 rows). Since our pricing data starts 10/17/2021, we’ll only use 13 rows of data. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Since all of the data collected comes from Bloomberg, the data is already structured and doesn’t require a lot of cleaning. After the export and download into a single excel workbook, we performed two phases of transformation: 3.2.1 Creating return series Our futures data comes in the form of prices at each 15 minute interval. We captured critical interval prices, and created a daily return series that measures various time-to-close (t-15min, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 to 120min) ranging from t-15min to t-120min. In addition, we also created a daily return series measuring the open-to-t-15min and open-to-30min, as we’ll explore the day-of-return as independent variables. Finally, each of these return series is transformed into columns assigned to each day, such that for each day, we have returns of t-15-to-close, t-30-to-close, etc. 3.2.2 Combining independent variables with pricing series Since most of the independent variables are weekly or monthly, we have to backfill those data series with latest data available. 3.3 Missing value analysis The data sets that we’ve chosen are all highly structured pricing, transaction, or survey data that have no missing data. All the pricing and market data, takes the latest date available. The only data point missing is the latest data for ISM/Services because the latest point wasn’t released. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 By Day of Week 4.2 By Same Day Returns 4.3 By Other Variables", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 By Day of Week First set of plots we did was to show how each day’s closing returns differ by Day of the Week. We thought that perhaps Friday would have a different pattern if investors and traders were to close out their positions on a weekly basis. The first plot showed the final 15 minutes of return grouped by Day of the Week. Besides some larger variability on Thursdays there isn’t a clear distinction from this chart. most days have similar averages and ranges. We thought that perhaps if we defined “closing” time as the final 30 minutes instead of 15 minutes we might have a different finding. This turns out to give us that Wedsnesdays during this past year have generally experienced lower average closing 30 minutes returns. If we stretched this out as long as final 60 minutes, the Wednesday pattern goes away, but there appears to be larger positive outliers. 4.2 By Same Day Returns We thought that perhaps the day’s return would be a reason the closing return would be higher or lower. As it turns out if the returns earlier in the day is higher than 0.02, the closing return is usually lower. The vice versa is true for lower earlier returns to result in higher closing return. This is indicative of intraday mean reversion in return patterns. 4.3 By Other Variables Often we can see market return be affected by the market conditions. The following charts will examine how the current market regimes might produce higher or lower closing returns. 4.3.1 VIX VIX is known as the fear index, and is a common indicator for the level of volatility and anxiety in the market. The following chart shows that the higher the index, the more variation we’re seeing in closing returns. This is not surprising in that higher return volatility should produce a wider range of closing returns. This is likely showing more correlation than causation. 4.3.2 Net Bull Index AAII’s Net Bull Sentiment is a net indicator of the AAII Bull Sentiment - AAII Bear Sentiment. It shows how “net” bullish investors are about the market We see below that when investors are net-bearish (negative values) the range of returns widen considerably. 4.3.3 Market P/E Ratio P/E Ratio stands for Price to Earnings Ratio. The Market’s P/E Ratio is a pricing indicator to measure the valuation of the average market. When it’s lower, the market is pricing the earnings of the average company to be lower. The ratio is typically lower than the overall returns are lower to negative, and also consistent with that the lower the P/E Ratio is the wider closing returns appears to be. 4.3.4 Other variables omitted We also looked into Net Positioning, Fed Funds Rate and ISM Index, but neither showed much relationship with the closing returns. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component 5.1 Description 5.2 D3 Chart", " Chapter 5 Interactive component 5.1 Description One of the most compelling and actionable observations is that the S&amp;P futures returns in the last 15 minutes of trading exhibited mean reversion when there were extreme daily returns during market hours. For instance, we observed that when the futures returned more than 2% from market open (09:00) to 15 mins before close (15:45), almost all (8 out of 10 observations) exhibited negative returns. Similarly, when the futures return was less than -2%, most of the returns (8 out of 12 observations) for the last 15 mins were positive. To illustrate this observation, we have constructed an interactive graph that shows the actual price movements for 2 separate days: one where the daily return up to the last 15 minutes was greater than 2%, and another where the return was less than -2%. The animated dots represent the closing price of each scenario reflecting the actual returns of the middle 5 observations. 5.2 D3 Chart "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion The initial thesis that inspired this project was an observation that there seemed to be a short squeeze type of rally in S&amp;P futures at the end of trading days on the very last day of the week. One of the potential reasons that was posited was that traders with short positions would not want to be exposed over the weekend when potentially good news could be announced. This was particularly true during the 2008 financial crisis when central banks were eager to support the markets and usually took action Sunday evenings. However, based on our exploratory data and visualization efforts, we found that there were no significant differences in the end of day returns on Fridays vs the rest of the week. In terms of patterns based on days of the week, the only thing we found was that end of day returns on Wednesdays appeared to be worse than the rest of the week. Furthermore, after isolating each of the other independent variables to see what effect they might have on end of day returns, we made two additional observations. When charting the end of day returns against rest of the day returns, we found that the returns were negatively correlated. For instance, we observed that when the futures returned more than 2% from market open (09:00) to 15 mins before close (15:45), almost all (8 out of 10 observations) exhibited negative returns. Similarly, when the futures return was less than -2%, most of the returns (8 out of 12 observations) for the last 15 mins were positive. We found that the volatility of end of day returns were correlated to 3 independent factors: VIX (positive correlation) Net Bearish Sentiment (positive correlation) PE Ratio (negatively correlated) Given that the VIX and Net Bearish sentiment are positively correlated and both are negatively correlation to PE ratio, this pattern seems to make sense. However this second observation is not actionable since the primary method of taking advantage of the higher volatility in end of day returns would be to buy options which would already be expensive since the VIX is at an elevated level. On the other hand, the first observation of mean reversion in the returns in the last 15 minutes is definitely actionable since you can simply go long or short the index to capture the expected positive returns. Since there were only 22 instance in the past year of extreme returns in the beginning of the trading day, this may not be a viable primary trading strategy, but it could definitely serve as a supplementary trading strategy as part of a pool of diversified strategies.
